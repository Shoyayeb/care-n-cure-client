                            All of our doctors are well educated and screened to ensure they are able to discuss topics in the general physician field. Our physicians respond to our patients on a rotating basis to ensure 24 hour coverage.

                            With this continuous coverage, we cannot guarantee that you will be able to speak to a specific doctor at any given time.

                            In some cases, the doctor on call may transfer you to a specific physician if they determine another physician could provide better insights for your particular medical concern.
